# Basterdized

Color scheme using [Solarized Dark](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/) colors on a neutral dark background.

Uses minimal syntax highlighting similar to the [Alabaster](https://github.com/tonsky/vscode-theme-alabaster/tree/master) color scheme, with slight modifications for preference.
